## Commercial Paper tutorials (2020 - series of 3 tutorials


In this repo there are tutorial docs and supporting files for the  **IBM Blockchain Platform VS Code Extension Commercial Paper tutorial series**  - the current editions located on IBM Developer at https://developer.ibm.com/series/blockchain-running-enhancing-commercial-paper-smart-contract/ are out of date and will be replaced in due course (probably during July 2020).

The old series have been revised


1. Running and executing a commercial paper locally in development, using the IBM Blockchain Platform VS Code extension
2. Developing and enhancing the smart contract, adding a range of query transaction functions, both simple and advanced. Then testing these work locally.
3. Building a pilot IBM Blockchain Platform 2.5 'commerce' network in IBM Cloud, consisting of three organisations: MagnetoCorp, DigiBank and Hedgematic. You will use the IBM Blockchain Platform ansible collection](https://ibm-blockchain.github.io/ansible-collection/) to do this (you'll be provided the ansible playbooks too). Once built, you'll:

- connect up to your remote blockchain network in IBM Cloud using the VS Code extension
- test the new functionality added to the smart contract all 3 organisations will use.  
- connect up your client applications to be able to interact with the network and finally
- use client browser apps to render HTML 5 reports: asset history and the deltas history.

A summary of the end-to-end cycle is shown here:
